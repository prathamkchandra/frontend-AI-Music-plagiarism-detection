##  Why this project

Plagiarism in music — from melody reuse to sampling or inadvertent resemblance — has always been hard to quantify.  
This tool blends tried-and-true methods (spectrograms + convolutional neural networks + cosine similarity) with modern web technologies to offer a **quantitative, shareable, and user-friendly** solution for artists, producers, and reviewers.  
It’s a step toward preserving creative integrity while embracing innovation.

##  Tech Stack  

| Part | What / Tools |
|------|--------------|
| Frontend | React + Next.js (TypeScript / JavaScript, CSS) |
| Hosting / Deployment | Vercel (live demo) |
| Backend / ML (recommended) | Audio → Spectrogram → CNN Embeddings → Cosine Similarity (your custom model) |
| Dataset | Folder-based collection: `AudioFiles`, `Spectrograms`, precomputed embeddings, etc. |
